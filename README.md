A study conducted by a team of SSE Riga students. 
In this study, we investigated the potential influence of the Italian National Football team's performance on Italian stock market returns, focusing on the FTSE Italia All Share, MIB, Mid Cap, and Small Cap indexes. 
Despite employing various analytical methods, including visual, logical, numerical, and econometric analyses, our findings from primitive visual analysis suggested no clear evidence of behavioral biases affecting stock market returns. 
Volatility and alpha analyses revealed changes influenced by economic cycles and macroeconomic policies, but regression results indicated some impact of football matches on stock indexes, particularly on the next day returns. 
However, the weak explanatory power of regressions cautioned against definitive conclusions. While our research enhances understanding of Italian stock index returns, it falls short of predicting future returns. 
Data files used in the study are provided at the leisure of the reader.
